## Use-Case
BeHappy is designed mostly for movie audiotrack transcoding. It's a powerful BeLight/BeSweet replacement with XML based plugin system for source, dsp and encoder plugins.

If you need to transcode multiple files at "one click" and/or tagging support - try [foobar2000 converter](https://foobar2000.org/) or [LameXP](http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/).

A rich selection of plugins is already integrated aswell most of the required encoder executables (except non redistributable encoders like most of the aac encoders).

As prerequisite a working AviSynth environment is required to use BeHappy. If you have no knowledge about AviSynth, simply use the [installer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2/files/AviSynth%202.6/AviSynth%202.6.0/).
