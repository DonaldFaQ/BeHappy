BeHappy is an AviSynth-based audio transcoding tool written in C#.

## Use-Case
BeHappy is designed mostly for movie audiotrack transcoding. It's a powerful BeLight/BeSweet replacement with XML based plugin system for source, dsp and encoder plugins.

A rich selection of plugins is already integrated aswell most of the required encoder executables (except non redistributable encoders like most of the AAC encoders).

As prerequisite a working AviSynth environment is required to use BeHappy. If you have no knowledge about AviSynth/Avisynth+, simply use the installer from [there](https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus/releases/latest). 

For further help and some screenshots have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/jones1913/BeHappy/wiki).

## Kurtnoise fork
I decided to fork the main tree in order to update the tool but also take back into action the latest features from Avisynth+ (especially channel mask for audio transcoding).
