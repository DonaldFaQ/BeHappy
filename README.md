BeHappy is an AviSynth-based audio transcoding tool written in C#.

## Use-Case
BeHappy is designed mostly for movie audiotrack transcoding. It's a powerful BeLight/BeSweet replacement with XML based plugin system for source, dsp and encoder plugins.

A rich selection of plugins is already integrated aswell most of the required encoder executables (except non redistributable encoders like most of the AAC encoders).

As prerequisite a working AviSynth/+ environment is required to use BeHappy. If you have no knowledge about AviSynth/+, simply use the [installer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2/files/AviSynth%202.6/AviSynth%202.6.0/).
